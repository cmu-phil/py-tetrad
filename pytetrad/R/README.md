## RPy-Tetrad: Py-Tetrad for R and RStudio

This project is being offered as a way of connecting Tetrad to R through Python. It is intended as an alternative the older (less maintainable) [r-causal](https://github.com/bd2kccd/r-causal) Python project that uses an outdated version of Tetrad. Another alternative we are developing is [r-tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/r-tetrad), which uses rJava in R to access the Tetrad Java code, without requiring the user to install anything but R.

Here are [INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS](https://github.com/cmu-phil/py-tetrad/blob/main/pytetrad/R/INSTALLATION.md).

Here is some [INITIAL DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/cmu-phil/py-tetrad/blob/main/pytetrad/R/DOCUMENTATION.md).

If you have questions or need more (or different) functionality, or are just flummoxed by the installation procedure, available algorihtms, knowledge functionality, or output graph formats, [let us know](https://github.com/cmu-phil/py-tetrad/issues). Although all of the functionality is from an established project, [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad), this R interface has been available only as of 2023-04-04, so [feedback](https://github.com/cmu-phil/py-tetrad/issues) is very welcome. And thanks for all the feedback we've gotten so far--much appreciated!
